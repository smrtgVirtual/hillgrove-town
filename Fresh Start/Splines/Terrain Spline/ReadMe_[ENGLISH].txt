PREFACE:

	This is the new Terrain-Splines version 4.2!
	You have downloaded over 100 new terrain splines, which are included into this package.
	Most important changings of this new version 5.1 are that many new textures have been added.

	Please read the Readme completely and carefully to prevent an incorrect installation!

INSTALLATION:

	1.) Do a backup!
	2.) Copy the folder 'Splines' into your Omsi main folder (in most cases: 'C:\m-r-software\Omsi'
	    or 'C:\Programme (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Omsi 2')
	    Confirm all overwriting notes with 'Yes'.

TIPS FOR DEVELOPERS:

	All new splines are compatible with the old ones. The old ones have just been improved, not corruptet.
	We are not giving any support to the old versions anymore, so you should just use version 4.0 or higher in your (new) maps.
	Into this new package all old splines are included except of some, which unfortunately were not used really often (in brackets are the alternative ones
	to replace given):
	Terrain-Spline_Blätter (Terrain-Spline_Innenstadt14), Terrain-Spline_Blumen2 (Terrain-Spline_Blumen), Terrain-Spline_Blumen3 (Terrain-Spline_Blumen),
	Terrain-Spline_Blumen4 (Terrain-Spline_Blumen), Terrain-Spline_Busch (Terrain-Spline_Gras4), Terrain-Spline_Busch2 (Terrain-Spline_Gras4),
	Terrain-Spline_Fels (Terrain-Spline_Gras-mit-Fels), Terrain-Spline_Hafen2 (Terrain-Spline_Hafen), Terrain-Spline_Holzbretter2 (Terrain-Spline_Holzbretter),
	Terrain-Spline_Moos (Terrain-Spline_Gras4), Terrain-Spline_Steine (Terrain-Spline_Kieselsteine), Terrain-Spline_Strandsand2 (Terrain-Spline_Strandsand),
	Terrain-Spline_Strandsand3 (Terrain-Spline_Strandsand), Terrain-Spline_Sumpf (Terrain-Spline_Gras4)

	If one or more of these are used on a map, you have to replace them in the editor with the alternative one in brackets. Please do not forget to give the
	map autor a little feedback.
